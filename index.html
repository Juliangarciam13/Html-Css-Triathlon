              <h2>Â¿What Is a Triathlon?</h2>
                  <p class="Section2">
                    A triathlon is a type of multisport race that involves swimming, biking, and running across long distances. <br>
                    A triathlon race is typically one continuous event with only short breaks in between each activity to allow <br>
                    the athletes time to prepare for the next portion of the triathlon race. Many triathletes wear tri-suits which <br>
                    prevent the need to change outfits between events. The competitors begin with an open-water swim or pool swim. <br>
                    Then, competitors have a short opportunity to change out of their wetsuits or swim caps, put on cycling shoes, <br>
                    and get onto their triathlon bikes. The next portion of the race is a bike ride, taking place either on an off-road <br>
                    course or on city streets. Then the cyclists transition into running shoes to cross the finish line during the running <br>
                    portion of the event. <br>

              <h2>Six Popular Triathlon Distances</h2>
                <p>
                  Triathlon distances vary based on the event organizer and age group, and race distances are often subject to change. <br>
                  Modified triathlons use different combinations of distance events, such as the aquathlon (running and swimming), 
                  the aquabike (swimming and biking), and the duathlon (running, biking, and then running again). <br>
                </p>
                <ul class="Section3">
                    <li><strong>Olympic-distance triathlon:</strong> The Olympic games set the standard for the triathlon with the Olympic triathlon <br>
                        distances involving a swim for 0.93 miles, a cycling route across 24.8 miles, and a run for 6.2 miles.</li> <br>
                    <li><strong>Sprint-distance triathlon (mini-triathlon):</strong> A sprint triathlon is half of the Olympic distances. It includes <br>
                        a swim for  0.5 miles, a cycling route across 12.4 miles, and a run for 3.1 miles.</li> <br>   
                    <li><strong>Super-sprint triathlon:</strong> A super sprint triathlon is the shortest triathlon event for entry-level athletes. <br>
                        It has a short course with a 0.25-mile swim, a bike course across 6.2 miles, and a 1.5-mile run.</li> <br>
                    <li><strong>Ironman triathlon:</strong> The Ironman race originated in Hawaii and was one of the first triathlon events. Today <br>
                        the standard  Ironman distances for the Ironman world championships include a swim for 2.4 miles, a cycling <br>
                        route across 112 miles, and a run for 26.2 miles.</li> <br>
                    <li><strong>Half-Ironman triathlon (half-iron):</strong> A half-Ironman is a shorter version of the full Ironman event, consisting <br>
                        of a swim for  1.2 miles, a cycling route across 56 miles, and a run for 13.1 miles.</li> <br>
                    <li><strong>ITU long-distance triathlon:</strong> The ITU triathlons are world championships organized by the International Triathlon <br>
                        Union that involve a swim for 2.5 miles, a cycling route across 74.5 miles, and a run for 18.6 miles.</li> <br>

                   The primary distinguishing feature of running in a triathlon is that it occurs after the athlete has already been <br>
                   exercising in two other disciplines for an extended period of time, so many muscles are already tired. The effect of <br>
                   switching from cycling to running can be profound; first-time triathletes are often astonished at their muscle weakness, <br>
                   which may be caused by lactate accumulation and the bizarre, sometimes painful sensation in their thighs a few hundred <br>
                   yards into the run, and discover that they run at a much slower pace than they are accustomed to in training. Triathletes <br>
                   train for this phenomenon through transition workouts known as "bricks": back-to-back workouts involving two disciplines, <br>
                   most commonly cycling and running. <br>

                   Triathlon cycling can differ from most professional bicycle racing depending on whether drafting is allowed during competition. <br>
                   In some competitions, like those governed by USA Triathlon and the World Triathlon Corporation, drafting is not allowed, <br>
                   and thus the cycling portion more closely resembles individual time trial racing. In other races, such as those in the World <br>
                   Triathlon Series and World Triathlon Cup racing, drafting and the formation of pelotons are legal.This places an emphasis <br>
                   on running performance as several athletes will enter the bike to run transition at the same time due to drafting.<br>

                <p>
                   Triathletes will often use their legs less vigorously and more carefully than other swimmers, conserving their leg muscles <br>
                   for the cycle and run to follow. Many triathletes use altered swim strokes to compensate for turbulent, aerated water and to <br>
                   conserve energy for a long swim. In addition, the majority of triathlons involve open-water (outdoor) swim stages, rather than <br>
                   pools with lane markers. As a result, triathletes in the swim stage must jockey for position, and can gain some advantage by <br>
                   drafting, following a competitor closely to swim in their slipstream. Triathletes will often use "dolphin kicking" and diving to <br>
                   make headway against waves, and body surfing to use a wave's energy for a bit of speed at the end of the swim stage. Also, open-water <br>
                   swims necessitate "sighting": raising the head to look for landmarks or buoys that mark the course. A modified stroke allows the <br>
                   triathlete to lift the head above water to sight without interrupting the swim or wasting energy. <br>
