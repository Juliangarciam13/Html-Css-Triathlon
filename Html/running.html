            For new runners who want to train to complete a race, 5K competitions are an ideal starting point. <br>
            They are races with a length of 5 kilometers where each runner can give their best, in a relatively <br>
            short time and distance. There are many 5k events, ranging from popular races to highly competitive <br>
            races for the most experienced. These events are very popular with both new and experienced runners, <br>
            and are a great way to raise money for a good cause. <br><br>

           <p>
            A 10k race has a distance of 10 kilometers. It is ideal for experienced runners looking for more of a <br>
            challenge. It's the second most popular race after the half marathon and requires a level of fitness <br>
            that balances strength, energy, and stamina. If you've already run a 5K and like to run longer distances, <br>
            the 10K may be the ideal next step. Completing a 10km race is an achievement in itself, being able to be <br>
            happy with your time no matter what. However, it is normal that you want to share with other runners, as <br>
            well as with your previous best times. Your age, cardiovascular condition, and musculoskeletal health can <br>
            influence your individual performance, but the average 10K time is 50 to 70 minutes. <br>

            A half marathon, or 21K race, is a race that is exactly 21.0975 km long, half a marathon or 42K, which is <br>
            42.195 km. In the grandest scheme of all races, the half marathon is in the middle of the road for racing. <br>

             A marathon is a race with a distance of 42.195 kilometers. Although marathons differ in their terrain and <br>
             degree of difficulty, the distance is always 42.195 km. Legend has it that Pheidippides, a Greek messenger, <br>
             ran 40 kilometers from Marathon to Athens to deliver the news of the Athenians' victory over the Persians in <br>
             490 BC. C. He arrived to declare "Nikomen", which is "We won" in Greek. The word is derived from the name of <br>
             the goddess Nike (Victory). Today, you can run a marathon wearing Nike on your feet.<br>
