           <p>
            For new runners who want to train to complete a race, 5K competitions are an ideal starting point. <br>
            They are races with a length of 5 kilometers where each runner can give their best, in a relatively <br>
            short time and distance. <br>
            There are many 5k events, ranging from popular races to highly competitive races for the most experienced. <br>
            These events are very popular with both new and experienced runners, and are a great way to raise money <br>
            for a good cause. <br>
           </p> 
          <li><h3><em>¿Is it difficult to run 5 km?</em></h3></li>   
           <p>
            If you're just starting out running, 5km might seem like a long distance, but there are plenty of <br>
            tried and tested training plans, like the ones we show you HERE, that will get you from your couch to <br>
            the finish line in a matter of weeks. Once you're comfortable with the distance, you can start working <br>
            on improving your speed and the time it takes to cover those 5Ks. <br>
           </p>
          <li><h3><em>Ultimate Guide to 5K Races</em></h3></li> 
           <p>
            Walking is a great way to ease into 5K training. Smartwatches and fitness tracking tools are becoming an <br>
            increasingly popular way to monitor fitness progress, with step counting being a key feature. Most fitness <br>
            trackers recommend walking 10,000 steps a day, but even starting with around 5,000 steps a day can be a lot of <br>
            progress toward your goal, whether it's losing weight or running that 5K. <br>

          <li><h3><em>¿What is a 10K race?</em></h3></li>
           <p>
            A 10k race has a distance of 10 kilometers. It is ideal for experienced runners looking for more of a challenge. <br>
            It's the second most popular race after the half marathon and requires a level of fitness that balances strength, <br>
            energy, and stamina. <br>
            If you've already run a 5K and like to run longer distances, the 10K may be the ideal next step. <br>
            Completing a 10km race is an achievement in itself, being able to be happy with your time no matter what. However, <br>
            it is normal that you want to share with other runners, as well as with your previous best times. <br>
            Your age, cardiovascular condition, and musculoskeletal health can influence your individual performance, <br> 
            but the average 10K time is 50 to 70 minutes. <br>
           </p>
          <li><h3><em>Average time of a 10K race</em></h3></li>
           <p>
            Most runners who are reasonably fit and run an average of 25 to 50 km per week should finish this type of race in an <br>
            average time of 50 to 70 minutes. <br>
            More advanced runners usually finish in about 43 to 50 minutes. While exceptionally fit runners can average under 40 <br>
            minutes, while more casual runners can exceed 60 minutes to cover those 10 kilometers. <br>
           </p>
          <li><h3><em>Other factors that affect the average time 10 K</em></h3></li>
           <p>
            Additionally, the average 10K time can depend on factors such as age, gender, and fitness level. <br>
            Your musculoskeletal health also comes into play, so you need to take steps to reduce pain, avoid injury, and run with <br>
            proper form. You must properly treat factors such as shin splints, plantar fasciitis, and runner's knee. <br>

          <li><h3><em>¿Do you know what a half marathon or 21K?</em></h3></li>
           <p>
            A half marathon, or 21K race, is a race that is exactly 21.0975 km long, half a marathon or 42K, which is 42.195 km. <br>
            In the grandest scheme of all races, the half marathon is in the middle of the road for racing. <br>
           </p>
          <li><h3><em>¿Why run a half marathon?</em></h3></li>
           <p>
            A half marathon is a good distance to try new challenges after running other distances like 5K or 10K. There are few races <br>
            between a 10K race and a half marathon. 15K races do exist, but they are extremely rare. A 21K gives you the chance to run <br>
            half the distance of a marathon and experience double the fun. <br>
            When you cross the finish line of the half marathon, you will have accomplished something that less than 90% of the world will <br>
            ever do. This is a great achievement and the memory will stay with you for the rest of your life. After your first half marathon <br>
            race, you'll probably be hooked and want to run your next race as soon as possible. <br>
           </p>
          <li><h3><em>¿How do I train for a half marathon?</em></h3></li>
           <p>
            Most new runners will need to spend 12-16 weeks training for a half marathon. If you plan on running the entire half marathon, <br>
            you'll probably need to spend about 12 weeks training for race day. This period of time can be shortened, especially if you are already <br> 
            running distances of approximately 10 km or more. <br>
            The weekly progression to train for a half marathon starts with running about 4 times per week. One of your race days will be called a <br>
            long distance run or long run for short. The other three run days will be base mileage build days. It is unnecessary at this stage, especially <br>
            for beginners, to include fast work days. You will have at least one rest day and two strength days combined each week. <br>

           <li><h3><em>¿Do you know what a 42K marathon?</em></h3></li>
            <p>
             A marathon is a race with a distance of 42.195 kilometers. Although marathons differ in their terrain and degree of difficulty, the distance is 
             always 42.195 km. <br>
             Legend has it that Pheidippides, a Greek messenger, ran 40 kilometers from Marathon to Athens to deliver the news of the Athenians' victory over <br>
             the Persians in 490 BC. C. He arrived to declare "Nikomen", which is "We won" in Greek. The word is derived from the name of the goddess Nike (Victory). <br>
             Today, you can run a marathon wearing Nike on your feet. <br>
             The distance of the modern marathon became 42.195 km at the 1908 Olympics, where the marathon course was designed so that it could start at Windsor Castle <br>
             and end at the Olympic stadium. <br>
            </p>
           <li><h3><em>Preparing to run a marathon</em></h3></li>
            <p>
             Before trying to run a marathon, it's a good idea to run for at least 6 months and run at least 3 times a week. If you've never run a race before, you should <br>
             probably start with a shorter race, like the 5K, 10K, or 21K half marathon. <br>
             Once you've completed a shorter running distance, you'll be in a better position to decide to take on the challenge of running 26 miles. <br>
             If you want to train for a marathon, it's important to follow a training schedule so you're properly prepared for the race, avoid injury, and feel confident <br>
             when you reach the starting line. <br>
             Having a training schedule to follow will also keep you motivated for the 4-5 months it will take you to prepare for the race. With a well-designed plan, you'll <br>
             steadily increase the distance of your long run for the week, and then reduce your mileage in the later weeks. <br>
             This training period also allows you to practice good hydration and nutrition to maintain your energy during the race. You'll learn how to avoid blisters, chafing, <br>
             and other common marathon injuries during long training days. <br>
            </p>
           <li><h3><em>Discipline</em></h3></li>
            <p>
             Training to run a marathon takes a lot of time, commitment, and determination. The most typical marathon training program usually involves at least six days per week of <br>
             training. This type of program takes up a lot of time and makes it difficult to balance with work, family, social life, etc. However, training many days a week is not <br>
             necessary and often ends up causing exhaustion and injuries. <br>
